# Red Sands

Red Sands is a Ruby implementation of a board game I enjoy. It's mostly an excuse for me to explore the Sorbet type system.

## Description

I've been interested in types and Ruby for a while, often in the form of Crystal-lang. However, for this project it was readily apparent that there would be a substantial amount of metaprogramming involved, which is not Crystal's finest point. The decision was therefore made to use Ruby and Sorbet.

## Installation

This section usually contemplates some real-world use. This is probably not that kind of side project.

## Usage

TBD
Ultimately there may be a UI for this project, but at the moment the goal is to develop a rules engine.
